    "Non-relational databases:\n",
    "A non-relational database is a database that does not use the tabular schema of rows and columns found in most traditional database systems. Instead, non-relational databases use a storage model that is optimized for the specific requirements of the type of data being stored.\n",

    "Features of MongoDB include the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Replication. A replica set is two or more MongoDB instances used to provide high availability. Replica sets are made of primary and secondary servers. The primary MongoDB server performs all the read and write operations, while the secondary replica keeps a copy of the data. If a primary replica fails, the secondary replica is then used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability. MongoDB supports vertical and horizontal scaling. Vertical scaling works by adding more power to an existing machine, while horizontal scaling works by adding more machines to a user's resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load balancing. MongoDB handles load balancing without the need for a separate, dedicated load balancer, through either vertical or horizontal scaling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less. MongoDB is a schema-less database, which means the database can manage data without the need for a blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    "Document. Data in MongoDB is stored in documents with key-value pairs instead of rows and columns, which makes the data more flexible when compared to SQL databases."
